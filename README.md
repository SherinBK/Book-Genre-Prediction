# Book-Genre-Prediction
Are you tired of spending hours trying to find a book that fits your preferred genre? Look no further! Our project utilizes the power of text mining and natural language processing to simplify the task of book classification.

Our goal is to classify books into their respective genres such as Fiction, Non-fiction, Mystery, and Adventure based on a small review of the book. By applying text mining techniques, we extract and preprocess the synopsis of the book to make it easier for users to find their preferred genre.
This project uses advanced text mining and natural language processing techniques to extract and preprocess book synopses. This enables accurate classification of books into various genres, such as Fiction, Non-fiction, Mystery, Adventure, and more. Built primarily on Python, our solution simplifies the process of finding the right book without wasting time. Whether you are a book lover or a library enthusiast, our project can help you easily find books that fit your preferred genre.

The project is primarily built on Python language and uses advanced NLP techniques to extract and preprocess text data. We also leverage classification algorithms to classify books into their respective genres accurately.
